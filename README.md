# median-approx-algorithm by Successive Binning
This is an algorithm to efficiently (in terms of space) calculate an approximate value of median of a distribution.
This approach was proposed by **Ryan J. Tibshirani** of Stanford University in the following [paper](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/median.pdf).

The jupyter notebook contains my python implementation of this approach while the js file contains my javascript implementaiton of the algorithm.
